## Toolchain FitNesse Plugin

A project to quick start and speed up automation using FitNesse and Hsac fitnesse fixtures combined with bootstrap-plus, AutoCompleteResponder and in-table debug features.
Usage: put the jar in the plugins directory and on your fixture classpath.

Import the necessary packages and be sure to set 'Pause Test Fixture' as a library if you want to be able to use the debug script table.
