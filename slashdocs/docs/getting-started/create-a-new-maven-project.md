# Create a new Maven project
Before we can go ahead and set up our first Toolchain project, some basic environment setup is needed. 

1. **Install the IntelliJ IDE.** We will use Intellij for easy Java SDK management, Maven project management and to run the Toolchain.
   The free Community edition will suffice [Download IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
   During the installation accept the default settings.

2. **Open Intellij and navigate to File/New/New Project...**

3. **Select project settings.** In the 'New project' select Maven in the left hand pane and select the Java 11 SDK.

4. **Name your project** and select the correct folder and finish the setup

5. **Open the project** either in a new window or in the current one

Now that our basic environment setup is done, we can proceed to [set up our Toolchain project](Set-up-a-toolchain-project.md)
